Submitted by: **Chelsea Heredia**

About this web app: **This application provides a list of locations for concerts around the state of Texas. After the user selects a location, they will be provided with a list of concerts available in that location. Each concert event also provides the name of the headlining artist and the date of the show as well.**

Time spent: **8** hours
