# WEB103 Project 3 - *Concert Calendar*

Submitted by: **Chelsea Heredia**

About this web app: **This application provides a list of locations for concerts around the state of Texas. After the user selects a location, they will be provided with a list of concerts available in that location. Each concert event also provides the name of the headlining artist and the date of the show as well.**

Time spent: **4** hours

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

<!-- Make sure to check off completed functionality below -->

- [X] **The web app uses React to display data from the API**
- [X] **The web app is connected to a PostgreSQL database, with an appropriately structured Events table**
  - [X] **NOTE: Your GIF or a screenshot added to this README must include a view of your Railway database that shows the contents of the table used by your app**
- [X] **The web app displays the title of the app**
- [X] **A visual interface allows the user to select a Location they would like to view**
- [X] **Clicking on a Location shows a list of all items from the Events table that corresponds to that Location**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] An additional page shows all possible `Events` that the user can sort and filter by `Location`

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app or any additional context you'd like to add.
Right now the app is showing a list of events instead of locations. Once you press on the event you are redirected to a unique event page instead of a location page. The event page involves a list of information for that event, instead of the unique location page showing a list of all the events. I will fix these functionality issues within 72 hours.
